0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project aims to archieve the following learning objectives:

	-Knowing at least four different sorting algorithms
	-Understanding the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
	-Knowing how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
	-Knowing what a stable sorting algorithm is

Tasks

	-Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
	   Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
	-Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
	   Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
	-Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
	   Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);
	-Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
	   Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);
